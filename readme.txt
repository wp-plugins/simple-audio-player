**Simple Audio Player** is in very early development. We'll build upon it over time to ensure that it has all and more of the features of the (now retired) original plugin from which it is was loosely based. Initially built as a lightweight option for [Internoetics](http://www.internoetics.com/ "Internoetics").

Future versions will add more features and functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What will the plugin do?**

The plugin is in very early stages. It will render a highly customisable media player on your WordPress website (with default browser player fallback).

**I can't see shortcode in my WordPress sidebar. What should I do?**

See our support website at [Internoetics](http://www.internoetics.com/2010/12/14/wordpress-audio-player-and-shortcode/) for a fix.

**What are the plans for the future?**

We plan on developing a huge number of options. They include:

* ID3 Integration.
* Administration area.
* More robust HTML5 fallback.

**Can I play multiple tracks?**

Yes, you can play multiple tracks or loop the same audio over and over.

**Can I customise the title on the player background?**

Yes, the title of each song is required if you want it to display (We'll add ID3 information in the next true release that'll do this for you). If no information is provided we'll render the name of your website inside the media player.

**How much of the player is customisable?**

You can customise virtually every component of the player by defining it in the shortcode. You can also define the width of the player (100% by default).
